# traffic

A command-line traffic simulation program that visualizes cars moving through a single intersection with traffic lights.

## Description

This program uses the terminal to display a grid representing a road intersection. Cars, represented by colored squares, are generated and move towards and through the intersection from all four directions (North, South, East, West).

The traffic lights cycle through standard green, yellow, and red phases to control the flow of traffic. The simulation continues until a predefined number of cars have successfully passed through the intersection.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, simply execute the Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python traffic.py
```
